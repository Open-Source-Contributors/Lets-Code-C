Unfortunately, Ayesha's dad was at home during the weekend, and she had to focus on studying for her exams. She decided to start with mathematics, but she couldn't find her calculator. As Ayesha struggles with calculations, your task is to write a C program using a switch statement to create a choice-based advanced calculator for her.

The calculator should allow Ayesha to perform the following operations and print the output:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulo
6. Floor Division
7. Find Square root of a number

Your program should prompt Ayesha to enter her choice (1-7) and the required inputs for the chosen operation. Then, it should perform the calculation and display the result.
