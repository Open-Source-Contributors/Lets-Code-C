Ayesha, despite scoring low in her exams, is planning her weekend with various activities. Her plans are outlined below, and your task is to use conditional branching to convert her plans into a proper code.

1. If Ayesha's mom is not at home, she will go to the mall. If her mom is at home, she will go for a picnic.
   
2. If she goes to the mall, she will watch a movie if tickets are available. If tickets are not available, she will go shopping.
   
3. If she goes for a picnic, she will have a cycle ride. If a cycle is not available, she will go for a walk.

4. If tickets are available at the movie, she will buy popcorn during the interval. If popcorn is too costly, she will buy chips.

5. If she goes shopping, she will buy a black purse. If a black purse is not available, she will buy a pink top.

6. If her father does not allow her plans, she has to study for her exams, and her mom cannot do anything about it.

Your task is to implement this scenario using conditional statements in C programming language. Use `printf` function to print Ayesha's decisions as statements.
Note: Either event will take place or not, their is no third possibility.
