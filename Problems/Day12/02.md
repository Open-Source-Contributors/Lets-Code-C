You are tasked with creating a C program to generate a pattern of stars. The pattern should have the following characteristics:

- The pattern should consist of 'n' rows.
- The stars in each row should first increase, then decrease, and then increase again, and so on.
- The user will input a positive integer 'n' (where n is less than 6) to determine the number of rows in the pattern.

### Pattern Example:

For example, if the user enters `n = 3`, the output should be:

```
*
**
***
***
**
*
*
**
***
```


### Conditions:

To ensure the proper functioning of your program, it needs to adhere to the following conditions:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The user must input a non-zero positive integer.
   - The input must be less than 6.

### Task:

Your task is to design a C program that generates this star pattern based on the user's input. Incorporate the necessary checks to handle various input scenarios. If the user fails to input a valid value, your program should prompt the user again until a valid input is provided. Ensure that the program produces the correct star pattern according to the specified conditions.
