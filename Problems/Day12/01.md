Imagine you are designing a decorative arrow frame using the C language for a special event. The arrow frame should consist of a pattern that resembles an arrow pointing upwards. Write a C program that takes an input size 'n' (where n is an odd number) from the user and prints a pattern as described below:

### Pattern Example:

For example, if the user enters `n = 5`, the output should be:

```
  *
 ***
*****
  *
  *
```

### Conditions:

To ensure the proper functioning of your program, it needs to adhere to the following conditions:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The user must input a non-zero positive integer.
   - The input must be an odd number to create a symmetric arrow frame.

### Task:

Your task is to design a C program that generates this arrow frame pattern based on the user's input, incorporating the necessary checks to handle various input scenarios. If the user fails to input a valid value, your program should gave wrong input message to user. 
Ensure that the program produces the correct arrow frame pattern according to the specified conditions.
