You are tasked with creating a C program to generate a pyramid-shaped pattern of stars. The pattern should have the following characteristics:

- The pattern should consist of 'n' rows.
- In each row, the number of stars should decrease initially, reach a minimum, and then increase again, forming a pyramid shape and only odd no of stars will be in each row.
- The user will input an odd positive integer 'n' (where n is between 1 and 6, inclusive) to determine the number of rows in the pyramid.

### Pattern Example:

For example, if the user enters `n = 3`, the output should be:

```
***
 *
 *
***
***
 *
```


### Conditions:

To ensure the proper functioning of your program, it needs to adhere to the following conditions:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The user must input an odd positive integer.
   - The input must be between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

### Task:

Your task is to design a C program that generates this pyramid star pattern based on the user's input. Incorporate the necessary checks to handle various input scenarios. If the user fails to input a valid value, your program should prompt the user again until a valid input is provided. Ensure that the program produces the correct star pattern according to the specified conditions.
