# Welcome to the Open Source Contributors' 21 Days Online Bootcamp - **Let's Learn C**

Greetings, and welcome to our 21 Days Online Bootcamp, where we've aptly named it **Let's Learn C**. Our goal is to transform you into a proficient C programmer in just 21 days. Throughout this journey, you'll be presented with a set of challenging and fun C coding problems each day. These problems will force you to read long theory, solve complex coding scenarios, and an exploration of programming.

To kickstart this exciting journey, your task today is to introduce yourself to us in the realm of C programming. You'll be answering five questions within your code to help us get to know you better. Here are the questions:

1. Hello! what's your name?
2. Why do you want to learn C?
3. As an aspiring developer, what inspired you to pursue programming?
4. If you could create any software or application, what would it be and why?
5. As you embark on your programming journey, what positive impact do you hope to make in the tech community or beyond?

Now, let me guide you on how to begin. You'll need to prompt the questions and then answer them within a single C program. Remember, you can't modify the questions; they should be printed as they are, and all questions should be included within the same C program. Here's a template to help you get started:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];
    printf("Hello! What's your name? ");
    // Your code to get the name input here.
    // Write your answer to question as comment.

    printf("Welcome, %s!\n", name);

    // Your code for the rest of the questions and their answers go here.

    return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile and run your program to ensure it works as expected. Additionally, provide clear and concise comments in your code.

Submission Guidelines:
- You will receive an assignment link.
- Commit your introduction answers in the C code.
- Submit a pull request when you're ready for your code to be reviewed.
We're excited to learn more about you and witness your coding skills in action! Best of luck!

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char name[50];
    printf("Hellow! What's your name?");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", name);
    printf("welcome,%s!\n", name);
    // Answer: satakshi verma // 
    
    char solution2[200];
    //Problem second//
    printf("Why do you want to learn C?\n ");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", solution2);
    printf("nice, keep it up,%s\n", solution2);
     // Answer2: C is powerful and commonly used in system programming //

    char solution3[200];
    //Problem third//
    printf("As an inspiring developer, what inspired you to pursue programming?\n ");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", solution3);
    printf("best of your luck,%s\n", solution3);
    // Answer3: Reseach the carrier opportunities and goals //


    char solution4[200];
    // Problem forth //
    printf("If you could to create any software or application, what would it be and why?\n");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", solution4);
    printf("good keep success,%s\n", solution4);
    // Answer4: As I'm beginner so i haven't thought about it yet //


    char solution5[200];
    // Prolem fifth //
    printf("As you embark on your programming journey, what positive impact do you hope to make in the tech community or beyond?\n ");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", solution5);
    printf("good,keep it up,%s\n", solution5);
    // Answer5: Learn yourself then teach and mentor other //

    return 0;
