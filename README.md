# Lets Code C Bootcamp

Welcome to the "Lets Code C" bootcamp! This program is designed to enhance your C programming skills through a series of daily coding challenges. Each day, you'll find a set of problems in the "Problems" directory to solve, and corresponding solutions will be available in the "Solutions" directory.

# Guides

## Coding Standards Guide

To ensure consistency and readability across all code submissions, participants are required to follow these coding standards:

1. **Indentation and Formatting:**
   - Use consistent indentation (e.g., spaces or tabs).
   - Format your code to enhance readability.

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Follow meaningful and descriptive variable and function names.
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions in languages that adopt this convention.

3. **Comments:**
   - Add comments to explain complex sections of code.
   - Ensure comments are clear and concise.

4. **Whitespace:**
   - Minimize unnecessary whitespace.
   - Use whitespace to separate logical sections of code.

5. **Consistent Naming Styles:**
   - Be consistent with naming styles throughout your code.

By adhering to these coding standards, we create a more collaborative and readable codebase. Participants are encouraged to review this guide before submitting their solutions.

For more details, refer to [CodingStandards.md](Guide/CodingStandards.md).
